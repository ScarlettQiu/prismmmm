Autonomous Marketing Mix Modeling powered by Claude. Point an AI agent at `program.md` and it runs **three independent MMM models**, critiques its own analysis through a five-agent loop, iterates on model configuration, and produces a stakeholder report — without human involvement.

The three-model approach is deliberate: **Ridge** (fast, regularised), **PyMC** (Bayesian), and **LightweightMMM** (positive-constrained) each make different assumptions. Where all three agree, you can act with confidence. Where they disagree, that's a diagnostic — thin data, collinearity, or a modelling assumption worth questioning. No single model can tell you this.

The five specialist agents keep roles separated so no single agent can both produce and approve its own output:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Explorer** | EDA before training — collinearity, anomalies, VIF, readiness score | `rounds/R01_data_exploration.md` |
| **Tuner** | Proposes one config change per round based on prior fit metrics | Updated `config.json` |
| **Codex Reviewer** | Sends pipeline scripts to GPT-4o + Claude for automated code review before each run | `rounds/R{N}_codex_review.md` |
| **Analyst** | Interprets ROI, contributions, and model agreement into a business narrative | `rounds/R{N}_analysis.md` |
| **Critic** | Runs 6 quality checks — overfitting, sign correctness, plausibility, consensus honesty, collinearity, sample size | `APPROVED` or `REVISE` |
| **Reporter** | Rewrites the approved analysis in plain English for a CMO audience, generates deck | `report.md` + `report.pptx` |
| **Proofreader** | Final check — number accuracy, uncertainty language, jargon, consistency, omissions. Edits report directly if needed | `PROOFREAD_CLEAN` or `PROOFREAD_CORRECTED` |

## Knowledge Layer (Notion)

PrismMMM uses a **Notion knowledge layer** as a live data dictionary. Business teams can update field descriptions, expected ROI ranges, and known data issues directly in Notion — no code changes needed. Every time `discover.py` runs it pulls the latest knowledge and merges it into `metadata.json`, which all five agents read.

Three Notion databases:

| Database | What it stores |
|---|---|
| **Field Definitions** | Column name, label, type (channel/kpi/control), unit, expected ROI min/max, description |
| **Business Context** | Brand, market, currency, seasonality notes, typical media share |
| **Known Issues** | Data quality problems with severity (high/medium/low) and recommended action |

### Set up Notion integration

1. Go to **https://www.notion.so/my-integrations** → New integration → copy the token
2. Open your Notion page → `...` → Connections → connect your integration
3. Run discovery with your token:

```bash
python discover.py --source csv --path ./data.csv \
  --notion-token $NOTION_TOKEN
```

Store the token as an environment variable — never hard-code it:
```bash
export NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_...
```

## Data Sources

The demo uses the [Multi-Region MMM Dataset for eCommerce Brands](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Multi-Region_Marketing_Mix_Modeling_MMM_Dataset_for_Several_eCommerce_Brands/25314841/3?file=46779652) published on Figshare under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Results are illustrative and not from a real brand.

`prepare.py` supports three data sources via `config.json`:

| Source | Config key | Install |
|---|---|---|
| CSV file | `"source": "csv"` | none |
| BigQuery | `"source": "bigquery"` | `pip install google-cloud-bigquery` |
| Google Sheets | `"source": "gsheet"` | `pip install gspread google-auth` |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScarlettQiu/prismmmm.git
cd prismmmm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install JAX and the full model libraries (recommended):
```bash
pip install jax jaxlib lightweight_mmm pymc-marketing
```

Both install cleanly on Python 3.10 (CPU, Apple Silicon and x86). Without them, LightweightMMM and PyMC fall back to scipy NNLS.

### 2. Point at your data

**Option A — use discover.py (recommended for any new dataset):**
```bash
python discover.py --source csv --path ./your_data.csv \
  --notion-token $NOTION_TOKEN   # optional — enriches with Notion knowledge
```

This auto-detects columns, generates `config.json` and `metadata.json`, and pulls your knowledge layer from Notion.

**Option B — use the included Conjura eCommerce MMM dataset:**

`data.csv` in this repo is a ready-to-use sample: 132 weekly observations for an Apparel brand (2021–2024), with 8 Google + Meta spend channels and revenue as the KPI. Already profiled and ready to run.

Source: [Multi-Region Marketing Mix Modeling MMM Dataset for Several eCommerce Brands](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Multi-Region_Marketing_Mix_Modeling_MMM_Dataset_for_Several_eCommerce_Brands/25314841) — Conjura via Figshare. Contains 93 brands across multiple regions and verticals.

```bash
# Already included — just run the loop:
Read program.md and run the loop.
```

### 3. Run the agent loop

Open a `claude` terminal session in this directory:

```
Read program.md and run the loop.
```

Claude orchestrates all five agents. Round 1 runs the Data Explorer first:

```
PrismMMM starting. Reading state.json…
Round 1: skipping Tuner (no prior results)
Spawning Data Explorer...
  EXPLORATION_DONE: rounds/R01_data_exploration.md
  Readiness score: 3/5 — 12 periods, August anomaly flagged
Running models... ridge ✓  pymc ✓  lightweight_mmm ✓
Spawning Analyst...
  ANALYSIS_DONE: rounds/R01_analysis.md
Spawning Critic...
  REVISE: 0% media contribution must be labelled as model failure, not neutral finding
Analyst revising...
  APPROVED
Spawning Reporter...
  REPORT_DONE: results/report.md + results/report.pptx
Round 1 complete.
```

### 4. Run more rounds

Each round the Tuner tries one config improvement:
- Round 1: baseline + EDA
- Round 2: Tuner adjusts adstock lag, re-runs
- Round 3: Tuner adjusts Hill slope, re-runs
- ...until test MAPE stops improving

### 5. New or updated dataset

```bash
# New rows appended — re-profile, keep round history
python discover.py --source csv --path ./data.csv --notion-token $NOTION_TOKEN
Read program.md and run the loop.

# BigQuery source
python discover.py --source bigquery \
  --query "SELECT * FROM project.dataset.mmm_weekly" \
  --project my-gcp-project \
  --notion-token $NOTION_TOKEN
```

## What Ten Rounds Revealed

Each round the agent tried one change and the Critic evaluated whether the results were trustworthy. Here is what happened:

| Round | Change | Best MAPE | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baseline | 23.2% | Data Explorer: 5 KPI anomalies, 76% zero-spend on Google Shopping |
| 2 | `adstock_max_lag` 2 → 1 | 20.4% | Short lag better for digital — MAPE improved 2.8pp |
| 3 | `hill_ec` 0.5 → 0.3 | 13.1% | Lower saturation unlocked attribution — MAPE improved 7.3pp |
| 4 | Per-channel adstock decays (from Notion) | 13.1% | **Meta Facebook first ✅ High agreement (CV 71% → 7.9%)** |
| 5 | Code review — PyMC axis bug + NNLS scaling fix | 14.1% | Two real statistical bugs caught and fixed |
| 6 | PyMC samples 50 → 500 | 13.3% | Posterior stability improved; meta_facebook held at CV < 20% |
| 7 | Full PyMC (clang++ C compiler enabled) | 15.1% | All three models now run properly; meta_facebook CV 7.9% confirmed |
| 8 | BayesianRidge replaces NNLS (y-standardisation) | 15.1% | BayesianRidge best test MAPE (15.1%); over-attribution bug exposed |
| 9 | BayesianRidge attribution cap (65% of KPI) | 15.1% | **meta_facebook re-confirmed at CV 4.5%** after cap fixed over-attribution |
| 10 | PyMC `saturation_beta` HalfNormal(1.5→0.5) | 15.1% | **google_search first Google channel below CV 50% (28.1%)** |

### Three milestones that mattered

**Round 4 — Notion knowledge layer** unlocked meta_facebook. Rounds 1–3 used a single global adstock decay of 0.4. Paid search decays in days; video builds over weeks. The Tuner applied domain-informed decay rates from Notion and meta_facebook's cross-model disagreement dropped from CV=71% to CV=7.9% in one round — knowledge the model could not derive from 132 data rows alone.

**Round 9 — BayesianRidge attribution cap** restored reliability after round 8's over-attribution. BayesianRidge's negative-coefficient channels were offsetting each other and inflating positive channel contributions above 100% of KPI. Capping total positive media attribution at 65% of KPI fixed the artefact, and meta_facebook settled at CV 4.5% across all three models.

**Round 10 — PyMC prior tightening** unlocked the first Google signal. The default `saturation_beta ~ HalfNormal(1.5)` allowed PyMC to assign any channel up to 150% of max KPI — prior-dominated and unconstrained by data. Tightening to `HalfNormal(0.5)` brought google_search's PyMC estimate from 100.6× to 48.6×, within 1.2× of Ridge. Google Search crossed below CV 50% for the first time in 10 rounds.

**Current confirmed findings (Round 10):**
- **meta_facebook**: CV 3.2% ✅ — Ridge 1.48× · PyMC 1.52× · BayesianRidge 1.60× — maintained or increase budget
- **meta_instagram**: CV 35.6% ⚠️ — directionally positive across all models, improving each round
- **google_search**: CV 28.1% ⚠️ — first cross-model signal; high ROI reflects demand capture, not creation

## Why Three MMM Models?

No single MMM model is right in all situations. Each makes different assumptions about how media drives sales.

**1. No model is always correct**
Ridge is fast and transparent but can shrink correlated channels to zero. PyMC captures diminishing returns and uncertainty but is slow and sensitive to prior choices. LightweightMMM enforces positive-only ROI but may over-attribute to correlated channels. Each has blind spots the others don't share.

**2. Agreement builds confidence, disagreement reveals risk**
When all three rank the same channel as top performer, you can act. When they disagree, that's a diagnostic — thin data, collinearity, or a modelling assumption worth questioning. A single model can't tell you this.

**3. Different models suit different situations**

| Situation | Best model |
|---|---|
| Quick first pass, any data size | Ridge — runs in seconds |
| Small dataset (<30 periods) | PyMC — priors compensate for thin data |
| Production budget decisions | PyMC — full credible intervals |
| Need positive-constrained estimates fast | LightweightMMM |
| Final validation | All three — consensus = trustworthy |

---

## Three MMM Models

| Model | Method | Uncertainty | Requires |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ridge** | Regularised regression + bootstrap (200 samples) | Confidence intervals | sklearn only |
| **PyMC** | Full Bayesian with DelayedSaturatedMMM | Posterior distribution | `pip install pymc-marketing` |
| **LightweightMMM** | BayesianRidge fallback (JAX unavailable on macOS M-series) | Regularised estimates | `pip install scikit-learn` |

Ridge always runs with no extra dependencies. LightweightMMM falls back to BayesianRidge (sklearn) when JAX is unavailable — BayesianRidge with y-standardisation and an attribution cap produces reliable channel estimates. PyMC falls back to a simple Bayesian LM if pymc-marketing is not installed.

## The Five Agent Roles

### Data Explorer
**Role:** EDA on the raw dataset before any model training — runs once per dataset (Round 1 only).

Produces a structured report covering: dataset overview, KPI distribution, channel spend analysis, pairwise collinearity (Pearson r + VIF), anomaly detection (z > 3σ), multi-entity check, and a 1–5 readiness score with specific recommended actions. The Analyst and Critic read this report every round to ground their interpretation in data quality facts.

### Tuner
**Role:** Iterates model configuration between rounds to improve fit.

Proposes exactly **one** config change per round — adstock decay, Hill slope, or PyMC sampling depth. One change per round keeps experiments comparable.

Decision rules:
- 6 channels zero ROI → reduce `adstock_max_lag`
- Models strongly disagree (CV > 50%) → reduce `hill_slope`
- PyMC test MAPE > 40% → increase sampling iterations
- All models test MAPE < 15% → no change needed

### Analyst
**Role:** Interprets raw model numbers into a business narrative.

Reads model output + EDA report. Covers ROI rankings, model agreement/disagreement, contribution plausibility, and what the data can and cannot support. Under 400 words, always cites actual numbers.

### Critic
**Role:** Quality gate — challenges the Analyst before anything reaches the report.

Runs seven checks. Issues `REVISE` with a specific reason if any check fails. Analyst fixes once, Critic re-reviews. Max one revision cycle — no infinite loops.

| Check | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **Cross-model agreement** | CV > 50% on a recommended channel — primary gate |
| **Prior sensitivity** | PyMC ROI >2× Ridge without explanation |
| **Overfitting** | R²=1.0 on small samples; test MAPE >30% unacknowledged |
| **Sign correctness** | Negative ROI despite confirmed spend |
| **Contribution plausibility** | Media <5% or >80% of KPI |
| **Collinearity** | Channels that co-moved, confusing attribution |
| **Sample size caveat** | Limitation not clearly communicated |

### Reporter
**Role:** Translates the approved analysis into stakeholder language.

Only runs after `APPROVED`. Plain English, no jargon, no model names in the headline. Uses business-friendly channel labels from the Notion knowledge layer. Produces `report.md` + `report.pptx`.
